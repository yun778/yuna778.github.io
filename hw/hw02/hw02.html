            Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
            Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
            Brown paper packages tied up with strings
            These are a few of my favorite things

            Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
            Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
            Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
            These are a few of my favorite things

            Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
            Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
            Silver white winters that melt into springs
            These are a few of my favorite things

            When the dog bites
            When the bee stings
            When I'm feeling sad
            I simply remember my favorite things
            And then I don't feel so bad

            우리가 평소에 무심코 지나갈 수 있는 일상의 모습들을 좋다고 꼽는 마리아의 모습을 통해
            나 또한 내가 놓치고 있던 소소한 즐거움을 찾을 수 있게 된다. 괜히 머리에 안개가 끼는 날에
            이만한 치료제가 없는 것 같다. </pre></p>
